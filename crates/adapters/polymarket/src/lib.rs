//! [VibeTrader](https://github.com/qOeOp/trade) adapter for the [Polymarket](https://polymarket.com) prediction market.
//!
//! The `vibe-polymarket` crate provides integration with the Polymarket CLOB API for
//! trading binary outcome contracts on the Polymarket prediction market.
//!
//! # VibeTrader
//!
//! [VibeTrader](https://github.com/qOeOp/trade) is a Rust-native
//! engine for multi-asset, multi-venue trading systems.
//!
//! The system spans research, deterministic simulation, and live execution within a single
//! event-driven architecture, providing research-to-live semantic parity.
//!
//! # Feature Flags
//!
//! This crate provides feature flags to control source code inclusion during compilation,
//! depending on the intended use case, i.e. whether to provide Python bindings
//! for the `vibe_trader` Python package,
//! or as part of a Rust only build.
//!
//! - `python`: Enables Python bindings from [PyO3](https://pyo3.rs).
//! - `extension-module`: Builds as a Python extension module.
//!
//! [High-precision mode](https://github.com/qOeOp/trade/blob/main/docs/getting_started/installation.md#precision-mode) (128-bit value types) is enabled by default.
