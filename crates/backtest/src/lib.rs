//! Backtest engine for [VibeTrader](https://github.com/qOeOp/trade).
//!
//! The `vibe-backtest` crate provides an event-driven backtesting framework that allows
//! quantitative traders to test and validate trading strategies on historical data with high
//! fidelity market simulation. The system replicates real market conditions including:
//!
//! - Event-driven backtesting engine with simulated exchanges.
//! - Market data replay with configurable latency and fill models.
//! - Order matching engines with realistic execution simulation.
//! - Multi-venue and multi-asset backtesting capabilities.
//! - Configuration and state management.
//! - Integration with live trading systems for direct deployment.
//!
//! # VibeTrader
//!
//! [VibeTrader](https://github.com/qOeOp/trade) is a Rust-native
//! engine for multi-asset, multi-venue trading systems.
//!
//! The system spans research, deterministic simulation, and live execution within a single
//! event-driven architecture, providing research-to-live semantic parity.
//!
//! # Feature Flags
//!
//! This crate provides feature flags to control source code inclusion during compilation,
//! depending on the intended use case, i.e. whether to provide Python bindings
//! for the `vibe_trader` Python package,
//! or as part of a Rust only build.
//!
//! - `examples`: Enables example strategies and the EMA crossover backtest example.
//! - `defi`: Enables DeFi replay APIs and data-engine routing.
//! - `streaming`: Enables `persistence` dependency for streaming configuration.
//! - `python`: Enables Python bindings from [PyO3](https://pyo3.rs).
//! - `extension-module`: Builds the crate as a Python extension module.
