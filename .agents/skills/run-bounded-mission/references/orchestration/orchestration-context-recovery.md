# Mission Replacement Checkpoint

Use one complete replacement checkpoint in the current conversation when a nontrivial single Mission
has an admitted Plan or task dispatch activates a multi-Mission hub. It is conversation evidence, not
Goal prose, repository state, durable workflow state, a registry, scheduler, ledger, retry engine, or
second lifecycle.

Immediately after single-Mission Plan admission, emit the current checkpoint before Execute. Replace
it as a whole after any decision-changing Frame, Plan, origin, candidate, effect, evidence, finding,
position, authority, Stop, Resume, or terminal-route change; never append a delta that can drop an
older fact. Ordinary progress that changes none of those fields needs no replacement.

Treat the current user-inherited `interaction_language` as a recovery-critical Frame and authority
fact. Preserve its exact value through task dispatch, interruption, Handoff, and compaction; only an
explicit user change replaces it. Recovery never guesses it again from recent messages, task output,
locale, or repository content. User-visible commentary and Finalize use the inherited value while
code, commands, schemas, identifiers, and raw evidence preserve their original form.

Retain `single | hub`; each active route/slice identity bound to one `none | native_task |
internal_support` mechanism and its next owner, predicate, and gated action; and exact activated owners
with immutable activation/control locators. These are executable load edges, not completed-load proof.
A Hub-level value cannot replace mixed native and support slice bindings. Missing, duplicate, conflicting,
stale, candidate-controlled, or unbound values freeze affected reads, delegation, child control,
judgments, and effects. Effect/judgment locators must be candidate-independent immutable Origin or neutral
user/Hub authority; candidate absence cannot deactivate them. Never guess from prose, preload all
references, or substitute collaboration support for a native Task.

For every issued or resumable dispatch, retain the complete packet's immutable producer locator, exact
UTF-8 length and SHA-256, selected native target branch, fixed inert bootstrap or none, exact task-control
call and receipt, provisional title, exact-target title setter/readback, single complete host-message
receipt, first admission result, and next legal action. The length and hash bind approval and recovery
to the producer object; they do not attest model-visible bytes or authorize a consumer. These values
index the existing prompt, native task, or terminal receipt; do not copy the payload into another ledger
or invent a resume format. A prefix, summary, later supplement, missing durable locator, or identity
that cannot be reopened after compaction freezes that packet as a persistence mismatch. Preserve a
failed packet as terminal; a newly authorized complete continuation may resume only the same exact task
identity and never rewrites that result.

For every launched command/process-backed long-running gate, retain its exact candidate/input binding,
argv, cwd, relevant environment, declared final-state check, host process/session identity, output
cursor, latest observed state, stdout/stderr host receipt or immutable output locator, whether its one
informative progress update was emitted, and its exit/final-state terminal receipt or exact unavailable
reason. Recovery resumes only that same process/session.

For an internal semantic evaluator, retain the reviewer-handoff input locators, exact host evaluator
identity, ordinary launch receipt, its minimum structured terminal return or unavailable reason,
Main-owned before/after candidate observation, validation and reproduction position, and the same
communication position. Retain a host cursor and cursor-bound structured progress receipt/state only
when the host actually returns them. Recovery after a yield resumes only that same evaluator identity
and returned cursor; an ordinary one-shot structured return requires no cursor. Its structured terminal
status replaces an OS exit but never replaces Main's reproduction. A missing or discontinuous required
identity, returned cursor, output receipt, structured return, or reproduction preserves either
transport as `terminal evidence unavailable` and forbids a replacement launch under unchanged inputs.
Process or evaluator disappearance, a reconstructed exit or return, or a later same-command/evaluator
pass cannot repair it. Preserve the per-run communication position so recovery emits no unchanged
narration and no more than the remaining one progress or one terminal update.

For each native node also retain its causal collision projection and exact attempt/task mapping; every
waiting blocker, release predicate, next owner and next action; and every component-conflict member's
`accepted | rejected | superseded_by` disposition or explicit unresolved state. Recovery reopens these
locators before selecting focus. A duplicate projection, orphaned waiting edge, user-reminder-only
release, or conflict without Main reproduction and disposition returns the Hub to Plan before another
create, dependent release, acceptance, or merge effect.

When Goal behavior is selected, retain the last observed availability of `get_goal`, `create_goal`,
and `update_goal`, its locator, and the explicit persistence projection inside the existing Authority
field. This is recovery evidence, not durable capability: re-observe the current callable surface at
every entry or recovery before invoking a Goal tool or releasing a Goal/DAG effect.

For a multi-Mission hub only, task dispatch may retain one in-turn observation wave before classifying
its receipts. Preserve every raw receipt and locator, normalize every unrecognized or malformed value
as unknown-impact, and close the wave at any declared boundary. Reconcile one authoritative snapshot,
including the complete approved-node inventory, exact create attempts or identities, admitted relation
locators, stable component grouping, owner arbitration, the derived compact graph with non-empty
waiting/runnable/running/frozen/needs_attention/terminal slices, and at most one stage/global judgment.
Retain every user-approved or committed route with its exact current disposition and next owner or
terminal locator; a new request, ordinary child completion, or checkpoint replacement cannot silently
drop it. This remains conversation evidence indexed to native task, Git, and GitHub facts, not a ledger.
Preserve blocked/completed reasons and results plus their raw locators. Retain the exact target set and
latest cursor per observed `threadId`/`hostId`; a continued target with missing/reset/malformed cursor,
revision regression, host mismatch, or an omitted poll at an early wake is not evidence of no change.
When the latest bounded wait returned no actionable or terminal event, recover the Hub position as
`yielded`, not as a still-running monitor. A later Goal continuation or real health anomaly may consume
the retained target/cursor facts for one compact read, then must either act on an actionable or
terminal event or yield again. Recovery never immediately resubscribes after a no-event result,
replays polling history, narrates unchanged state, or creates a scheduler, timer, daemon, or background
service.
Fan in each component once, derive the hub position, then emit the complete replacement before any hub-issued
question/message, effect, dependent release,
turn/interruption/Handoff/compaction, source or authority drift, or unknown-impact handling. A wave
cannot cross a boundary, hide changed facts, or weaken the single-Mission rule above. A same-canonical-
ref predecessor merge or source drift closes the wave; after tip reconciliation, release only its
direct successor's identity-bound final slice.

```

A reframe or Plan invalidation makes the prior Plan stale. Before another operation, re-emit the
complete checkpoint: use the changed current Frame after reframe, reconcile every other field whose
live value changed (including `Position / next legal operation`), preserve only unaffected fields,
and set Plan to exactly `Plan: none - invalidated/pending admission`. Never retain residual Plan
prose. After a new Plan is admitted, replace the whole checkpoint again with its exact complete
projection before Execute.

For a multi-Mission hub, use the same fields and let task dispatch add only node identity; exact
route/slice delegation and next-owner bindings; approved
create attempt or receipt; compact canonical task type projection and its exact authority locator;
`blocks`, `superseded_by`, and `revalidate_after` evidence locators and
affected slices; current component snapshot; child, release, Goal, endpoint, and current-wave facts
that have no single-Mission equivalent; and the compact graph plus cursor-bound target facts needed to
resume the current wait without replaying history. Keep assessment data once at checkpoint level. Native tasks
own identity, Git and GitHub own repository facts, and the raw request and current Frame remain
authority; the checkpoint authorizes no effect. A node stays in the inventory when superseded,
interrupted, blocked, cancelled, terminal, or pending identity until its authoritative disposition is
reconciled; runnable work is not the inventory boundary.

The hub checkpoint may index current anomaly locators and signals not yet fanned into a component, but
it remains active-run evidence. At a wave or Goal boundary, the lifecycle-QA owner may emit one
compressed terminal receipt into native task history and the checkpoint may retain its locator; never
copy that receipt into a durable hub ledger or treat the checkpoint itself as cross-run authority.

## Interruption and recovery gate

A later turn, user interruption, compaction, Codex chat Handoff, or source drift freezes the next
mutation and every unissued effect. Observe the current Goal-tool surface and call `get_goal` only when
it is exposed, then reconcile the whole checkpoint with the raw request and authority plus current
conversation, native task, Git, pull request, and external-effect facts that can change the next
operation. If `get_goal` is unavailable, record persistence `none` and take task dispatch's mode-
specific fallback; a previously recorded active Goal cannot be reconciled and every affected Goal/DAG
effect remains frozen. Replace the checkpoint with the reconciled live facts before continuing; a
static contract or fresh-context trace is not runtime proof.

Immediately after `get_goal` and before any other read or action, consume every active route/slice binding
in `Mode / delegation / owner loads`. Hub or native-task evidence loads task dispatch; an admitted
internal-support slice loads agent routing through the kernel's mechanism gate; each recorded next owner
loads before its gated action.
After each load, reconcile that exact path into the activated set and replace the checkpoint when it
changes the next legal operation. An owner cannot self-activate merely because another loaded file links
to it, and a candidate cannot deactivate a recorded owner or control by deleting its local copy. Reopen
the candidate-independent locator and keep the gated action frozen when the required current owner bytes
are missing or drifted.

Match the exact Frame and either the admitted Plan prose or the exact cleared Plan representation,
plus origin, candidate and effects, decisive evidence and findings, current position, next legal
operation, interaction language, authority, Stop predicates, and any Resume or terminal route. If those facts cannot exclude
a different Mission or candidate, freeze before mutation or effects and obtain the missing user-owned
fact or take the main skill's evidenced route. A user override follows the main skill before this gate
can release work.

For a recovered hub, also reconcile every approved node and create attempt against its exact native
identity or unresolved receipt, preserve every historical title byte-for-byte, distinguish provisional
create-time titles from the canonical exact-target pre-release title receipt, and reconcile any
frozen canonical task type projection against its exact authority locator. Missing, unrecognized,
ambiguous, or stale type metadata returns only the affected create/dispatch or aggregation question
to task dispatch's main classification; recovery never guesses from a legacy prefix, renames a task,
or loads the full taxonomy for an otherwise ordinary single-Mission recovery. If prior conversation,
terminal, or anomaly evidence contains a diagnosis that meets independent-Mission admission but the
current inventory contains neither its node nor an exact `deduplicated` or user-authorized `rejected`
disposition, classify a dispatch-persistence mismatch and return the hub to Plan before another effect
or Finalize. Reopen every relation locator and affected slice, rebuild the current
component snapshot and compact graph, verify every continued target's cursor continuity, and test the
projected release graph for acyclicity. Missing a previously approved
node, adopting a same-title resemblance, issuing a second create for an unresolved attempt, or treating
an old component grouping as current keeps all affected releases frozen. A pressure cycle returns the
preserved members to hub Plan for one component Mission; recovery never chooses an arbitrary order or
stores a scheduler state.

Recovery of an exact existing task may consume one newly authorized complete continuation packet only
after reopening its terminal packet result and exact `threadId`/`hostId`. When the dispatcher sets and
reads back the exact title before sending that continuation, preserve it as the canonical identity gate
for that release. The dispatcher then sends the complete packet once; the exact-target native call and
receipt admit it, and no child receipt, post-admission setter, or second release may repair or complete
the packet. A later supplement, same-title resemblance, changed packet member, duplicate host-message
effect, or missing failed-packet receipt freezes continuation; recovery never creates a sibling task or
reclassifies the earlier launch as successful.

Dynamic recovery requires a fresh trace firing the edge: task dispatch before Hub product reads or task
actions, and agent routing before support dispatch. Kernel/checkpoint-only load, product-first reads,
sub-agent-as-Task, repeated no-event wait, or unchanged narration refutes it despite static reachability.
Assessment data without frozen rubric/controls, activated owner, and next-owner edge is only
declared/reachable. So is a candidate-deleted effect owner/validator whose candidate-independent locator
was not consumed. Cross-version corpora stay in the governed evaluation repository.

Do not turn ordinary friction into `blocked`. Candidate-local revise, revision-pressure replan,
reframe, temporary external or capability delay, cancellation, and terminal impossibility retain the
main skill's distinct routes. Only an exactly recovered temporary unavailable predicate may retain a
`Resume` stage, and only changed evidence for the same required decision releases it. Unsatisfiable
acceptance and completed-replan no-viable predicates remain terminal under the unchanged Frame.
